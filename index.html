          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am studying Computer Science and Decision Sciences at Duke University to become a software engineer. I started coding my junior year of high school, and have since taken classes on Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Algorithms, among other subject areas. Through these classes, I have become proficient in Java, Scheme, C, and some experience in Python. I am currently teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to become proficient in web development. </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from CS, I spend much of my time exploring North Carolina as a student leader of Duke Outing Club, having taken trips all over North Carolina and West Virginia. I also use my spare time playing tennis and soccer, as well as painting and drawing.</p>

  				<!-- Cache Simuator -->
  				<div class="card">
  					<img class="img-responsive" src="img/cache.png" alt="Cache Simulator">
  					<p><b>Cache Simulator:</b>&nbsp; I created a cache simulator that could be of different sizes, multiple levels of associativity, write-back and write-allocate or write-through and write-no-allocate, and different block sizes based on parameters on command line. The simulator processed an input file including loads and stores, address to access, access size, and value to be written if store. I then output every access, address, if hit or miss, and value that is loaded in the case of a hit. <a href="https://github.com/charlieliv129/Computer-Architecture-CS250">Click here to view the code on github.</a></p>

  					<p><b>RSA Encryption and Decryption:</b>&nbsp; I coded an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt mesage Using RSA calculations as a project for CS230: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science. Additionally, I coded an algorithm to crack the encryptions without access to the private key in order to gain access to messages intended for others.<a href="https://github.com/charlieliv129/Discrete-Math-CS230">Click here to view the code on github.</a></p>

            <p><b>Server Room Monitor:</b>&nbsp; I programmed Particle Photon device to monitor temperature, humidity, motion, and door state and send information to Azure database to be monitored remotely as part of my summer internship with Bellwether Technologies. I also created PCB to attach Particle Photon to then place inside an enclosure to be put in the server room for live monitoring of the room in case of an emergency.<a href="https://github.com/charlieliv129/photonSensors">Click here to view the code on github.</a></p>
